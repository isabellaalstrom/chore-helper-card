# Chore Helper Card for Home Assistant
A custom card for Home Assistant that displays chores managed by the [Chore Helper integration](https://github.com/bmcclure/ha-chore-helper).

This card allows users to see their chores, mark them as complete, and configure the display to suit their needs.

The card is mainly made for personal use, however you are most welcome to use it in your Home Assistant instance. Do not expect me to honor any feature requests or promptly solve bugs.

## Features
Displays overdue chores at the top.

Shows chores for today and configurable future dates.

Allows users to mark chores as complete directly from the card.
